Electron app template
=====
I create this template for my fast developement. This contains some functions that I use regularly. I will list them below and make some brief explain.

## Specs
1. [electron-rebuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-rebuild) can fast rebuild some dependecies if you met some problem on your device.
2. [electron-reload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-reload) will auto reload your UI when you make changes.
3. [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) start a local server on port 3000(default).
